    "summary": "I'm enthusiastic about mobile app development and I'm a pretty fast learner.\n\nI usually use Flutter to create a mobile app. I love challenges and learn something new. I always hope that I can befriend a lot of people and grow together.\n\nI have created a few projects using Flutter for both Android and iOS.\nI was lucky to work on a few pretty cool projects. The government uses one of them (satpol pp) to record offenders of the covid-19's protocol. The other one is when I was an apprentice at the YCP Solidiance Digital team in Indonesia's branch, I'm participated with my senior to work on one project together. There's so much fun also very challenging!\n\nAnd I also enthusiastic about the mechanical keyboard, and audiophile music. I have a dream to adopt a cat or dog some day.",
